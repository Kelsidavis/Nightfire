## 📅 May the 4th Be With You

This project is a tribute to classic arcade space shooters—and to the stories of those left behind when the war is lost. While the galaxy celebrates freedom, you and your crew prepare for the **final battle** aboard a dying warship.

## 🎞️ Storyline

> Imperial Command has fallen. The rest of the battlegroup is dust.  
> Only one Star Destroyer remains—systems offline, turbolasers disabled, half the bridge crew dead.

You, the commanding officer of Nightfire must rally what's left. Engineers reroute life support to weapons.  
You order shields diverted to engines. Communications are jammed—no help is coming.

Waves of **X-Wings**, **A-Wings**, and **Y-Wings** close in.

This is your ship.  
This is your crew.  
This is **your last command**.
