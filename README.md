## 📅 May the 4th Be With You

Developed in celebration of **May the 4th**, *Nightfire: The Last Command* is a love letter to space battles, rebel starfighters, and old-school arcade shooters. Dodge through swarms of iconic fighters and return fire with twin green lasers in a one-pilot war for survival.

You are the last surviving ace. The armada is collapsing.  
Your job: **Hold the line.**
